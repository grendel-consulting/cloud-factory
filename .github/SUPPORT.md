## AWS Control Tower Versions

We're using a [forked version of AWS Account Factory for Terraform](https://github.com/grendel-consulting/terraform-aws-control_tower_account_factory),
to minimise operating costs and permit opinionated security choices specific to
our context; this is typically at most one release behind AWS.
